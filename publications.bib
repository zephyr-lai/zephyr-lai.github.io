  abstract="Gesture recognition using surface electromyography (sEMG) is the technical core of muscle-computer interface (MCI) in human-computer interaction (HCI), which aims to classify gestures according to signals obtained from human hands. Since sEMG signals are characterized by spatial relevancy and temporal nonstationarity, sEMG-based gesture recognition is a challenging task. Previous works attempt to model this structured information and extract spatial and temporal features, but the results are not satisfactory. To tackle this problem, we proposed spatial-temporal convolutional networks for sEMG-based gesture recognition (STCN-GR). In this paper, the concept of the sEMG graph is first proposed by us to represent sEMG data instead of image and vector sequence adopted by previous works, which provides a new perspective for the research of sEMG-based tasks, not just gesture recognition. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) are used in STCN-GR to capture spatial-temporal information. Additionally, the connectivity of the graph can be adjusted adaptively in different layers of networks, which increases the flexibility of networks compared with the fixed graph structure used by original GCNs. On two high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) datasets and a sparse armband dataset, STCN-GR outperforms previous works and achieves the state-of-the-art, which shows superior performance and powerful generalization ability.",

title = {Semantic Segmentation of Surgical Instruments based on Enhanced Multi-scale Receptive Field},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {With the rapid development of robot assisted surgery, the segmentation of surgical instruments becomes more and more important. However, compared with the natural scene segmentation, surgical instrument segmentation is more difficult. To solve this problem, we improve a high and low resolution fusion module, which aims to extract detail information and context information from the fusion feature map of high and low resolution. Then, in the last layer of the encoder, we propose the Enhanced Multi-scale Receptive Field module to generate more available receptive fields. Our method is validated on 2017 MICCAI EndoVis Robotic Instrument Segmentation Challenge dataset, and the result is better than the other methods. The extended experiment is carried out on the dataset of our surgical soft robot which has a content implementation.}

title = {A low-cost passenger safety protection system based on laser ranging},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {In 2021, the total number of motor vehicles in China has exceeded 370 million. In the process of getting off the car, avoiding accidents between passengers and non-motor vehicles is of great significance for reducing casualties and economic losses. Therefore, this paper designs a low-cost passenger safety protection system based on laser ranging. Following the principle of easy integration and miniaturization, the hardware design and software design of the system have been completed. The mathematical model of arrival time-distance of non-motor vehicle under various speeds is established. Laser-ranging data is used to build the map, and the map can be used for non-motor vehicle identification and speed estimation. The function and precision of the system are tested. The experimental results show that 1) the established model can automatically determine whether passengers can get off the car safely and close the door in dangerous situations; 2) the mapping method based on laser ranging can effectively distinguish between non-motorized vehicles and roadsides. The accuracy of non-motor vehicle speed measurement is about 90%. The designed passenger safety protection system has high practicability.}
