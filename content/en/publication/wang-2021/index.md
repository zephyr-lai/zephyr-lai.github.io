abstract: In 2021, the total number of motor vehicles in China has exceeded 370 million.
  In the process of getting off the car, avoiding accidents between passengers and
  non-motor vehicles is of great significance for reducing casualties and economic
  losses. Therefore, this paper designs a low-cost passenger safety protection system
  based on laser ranging. Following the principle of easy integration and miniaturization,
  the hardware design and software design of the system have been completed. The mathematical
  model of arrival time-distance of non-motor vehicle under various speeds is established.
  Laser-ranging data is used to build the map, and the map can be used for non-motor
  vehicle identification and speed estimation. The function and precision of the system
  are tested. The experimental results show that 1) the established model can automatically
  determine whether passengers can get off the car safely and close the door in dangerous
  situations; 2) the mapping method based on laser ranging can effectively distinguish
  between non-motorized vehicles and roadsides. The accuracy of non-motor vehicle
  speed measurement is about 90%. The designed passenger safety protection system
  has high practicability.
